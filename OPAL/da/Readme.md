# Overview
The ***Bytecode Disassembler*** (DA) is a library for disassembling Java bytecode and creating a one-to-one representation of the bytecode. 
This one-to-one representation is particularly suited to create a human-readable representation of the native bytecode that
facilitates understanding every single byte. 
The representation is also very well suited for the very fast generation of class files; see the **Bytecode Creator** (BC) library for further details.
